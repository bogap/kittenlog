# Kitten Log


In this project we want to implement a windows application to store and modify lists of different types of media (books, movies, manga, etc). We will use the API for different purposes such as creating a list of recommendations or displaying trends. In this application, the user will be able to add media files to the log, track the progress of viewing or reading, rate and leave comments.
